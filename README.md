# My Own Pytorch Code

This repo contains several files. 

I intend not to tell what each file aims to.

## Using
You can add this path into your *~/.bashrc*, which makes it possible wherever you can **import** these files.

'''
<br>export PYTHONPATH="PathofThisRepo:PYTHONPATH"
<br>source ~/.bashrc
'''

However, please let me know, if it works.

BTW, I am very grateful to K and Xinge.

Last but not least, **may the Force be with u.**
