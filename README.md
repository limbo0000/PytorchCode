# My Own Pytorch Code

This repo contains several files. 

I intend not to tell what each file aims to.

## Using
You can add this path into your *~/.bashrc*, which makes it possible wherever you can **import** these files.


Add this in your *~/.bashrc*
```
export PYTHONPATH="PathofThisRepo:$PYTHONPATH"
```
Then excute 
```
source ~/.bashrc
```
However, please let me know, if it works.
## Acknowledgement
BTW, I am very grateful to K and Xinge.

Last but not least, **may the Force be with u.**
